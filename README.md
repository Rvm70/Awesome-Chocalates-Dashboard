# Enhanced Insights into Awesome Chocolates with Power BI

I've created an interactive Power BI dashboard to provide a comprehensive overview of Awesome Chocolates' performance. This dashboard offers valuable insights into key metrics such as:
- Total Sales, Boxes, Shipments, Cost, and Profit
- Profit Percentage and Low Box Shipment Percentage
- Sales Trends by Month
- Shipment Breakdown by Product and Customer

## Key Features:
 - Dynamic Visualizations: Interactive charts and tables for easy exploration of data.
 - Actionable Insights: Identify trends, opportunities, and areas for improvement.
 - Data-Driven Decision Making: Empower informed business decisions.
